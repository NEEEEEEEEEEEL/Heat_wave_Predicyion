heat index- "Heat index" is what the temperature feels like to the human body, taking into account the impact of relative 
	     humidity and air temperature.

Definition: The heat index measures what the temperature feels like to the human body based on air temperature and relative
	    humidity.
Inputs: 
Air temperature
Relative humidity

utci-
Definition: UTCI is a more comprehensive index that evaluates the thermal stress on the human body due to the outdoor 
	    environment. It predicts how the human body would respond physiologically.
Inputs:
Air temperature
Relative humidity
Wind speed
Solar radiation (direct and diffuse)

The resulting MRT, a crucial parameter in assessing human response to radiant effects are then integrated with other atmospheric 
data to compute UTCI using the Fiala model, following established operational procedures (Bröde et al., 2012; Fiala et al., 2012)

mrt-
Definition: MRT refers to the average temperature of all surrounding surfaces (like walls, windows, floors, and the sun)
	    that emit radiation toward a person. It influences how the body absorbs heat through radiation, which can make
	    a significant impact on perceived temperature.
example-
For instance, on a sunny
April day, MRT can be higher than the air temperature due to the additional heat from the
sun, thus, the environment is warmer. This is a factor that came out very well because when it
comes to real applications like designing cities or worrying about epidemics, that measure
gives a complete picture. Urban planners can also use data from MRTs to inform them how to
reduce heat stress; whether commonly used building materials should be reflective; whether
trees should be planted; or how buildings should be designed to reduce the heat gain. Thus,
using the data obtained through MRT, public health officials can alert the public to heat and
institute measures to prevent heat and other heat-related illnesses.

points-
The Met department declares a "heatwave" when local temperature crosses 40 degrees and is simultaneously more than 4-5 degrees 
above the region's normal temparature.

Bangladesh in the east showed the highest mean UTCI range (26–32 °C), while Afghanistan had the lowest. In the west, along the 
India-Pakistan border, the daily maximum UTCI range was the highest (38–46 °C). The research also indicated increasing mean 
and maximum UTCI levels, with a 0.25 to 0.75 °C per decade rise in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and northwest India, particularly
during June to September.


high resolution data-
High-resolution data in deep learning refers to data that has a large amount of detail, typically in terms of higher pixel counts 
in images, finer granularity in temporal or spatial data, or greater precision in measurements. For example:

High-resolution images: In the context of image processing, high-resolution data means images with more pixels, which results in more 
detailed visual information. These images allow deep learning models to detect finer features, but also require more computational resources 
for processing.

High-resolution temporal data: This refers to data collected at shorter time intervals, offering finer granularity. For instance, in time-series
analysis, high-resolution data might involve minute-by-minute or second-by-second measurements instead of daily or hourly.

High-resolution spatial data: This involves data collected over a smaller spatial area, or at a higher frequency, allowing for more detailed insights,
such as geographical information systems (GIS) data at higher levels of detail.

ERA-5 HEAT-
fine resolutions (for instance 0. 25° × 0. 25°):
0.25° × 0.25°: This is the resolution of the data in terms of latitude and longitude. It means that the data is divided into grid cells where each cell represents an area that is 0.25 degrees in both the latitude and longitude directions.

Fine resolutions: This indicates that the data is measured with high detail or granularity, allowing for more precise analysis.

Data preprocessing-
Resampling: Regarding temporal data resolutions, climate data could be on an hourly, daily,
or even monthly basis depending on the observation made. For a more consistent method of
data analysis, the resampling techniques can resample the data to a standard time scale. For

example:
Upsampling: Pros: It could also be useful to convert daily data to hourly, in which case, one
has to interpolate the values.

Downsampling: Averaging or summing data on an hourly basis to present data on an
assessment of a day.

eg: Averaging or Summarizing: Integrating and aggregating information derived from multiple
    geographical grid cells into a single unified larger cell or group of distinct cells.

Feature Engineering: This is more effective because if one has to expand the features of the
climate to be analyzed, one can create new features that better capture the variation of this
climatic data.

Derived Variables: Developing new parameters, heat, cooling, or other relevant indices and
aesthetical parameters, aggregated from several climatic characteristics.

Heat Index (HI): They include; the Steadman equation which helps in estimating the HI
when taken in conjunction with the prevalence points of temperature and relative humidity
standard when used in establishing the Apparent temperature of a place.

insights-
There are four variables required for the computation of the UTCI: 2 m air temperature, 2 m dew point temperature 
(or relative humidity), wind speed at 10 m above ground level and mean radiant temperature (MRT).

The UTCI is valid at all spatial and temporal scales from the micro to the macro and suitable for a variety of applications-
It has been extensively used, for instance, to define the thermal environment and its variability under current and future climates

It has been applied to investigate the negative impacts of heat and cold exposure on human comfort and health, also within vulnerable groups 

It has also been implemented as a forecasting tool for weather conditions associated to thermal stress, such as heatwaves (***)

Further applications include tourism industry, outdoor recreational activities and occupational health

MRT and UTCI data are stored in Kelvin (K). They can be converted into degree Celsius (°C) by subtracting 273.15.

Highest MRT and UTCI values are found in almost all the Northern Hemisphere and the tropical regions.
MRT values are generally higher in desert areas, where the low cloudiness and high albedo increase the 
portion of the solar radiation incident on the ground and reflected by it.
